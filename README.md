# Cloudflare 2020 General Engineering Assignment
By Neil Pulido

A Cloudflare Workers project built to operate as a linktree-style website.

## How It Works
The project works by creating a wrangler Cloudflare project and parses a personalized JSON API containing all information needed to serve an HTML page.

## Running Locally
To run locally, you can start the project by running:
```
wrangler dev
```
and launching the localhost server in your preferred browser.

## Running Online
The page is also deployed online at the following URL:
```
https://worker.npulido.workers.dev/
```
## Extra Credit Notes
I implemented some of the extra credit portion such as updating the title field as well as changing the background color. 

## Final Notes
I had a ton of fun with this project and learned more about Cloudflare's Workers platform. I may end up using it to deploy my own personal site as I develop it more!
